                Tottenham have had much success over the years to go along with their
                success they have acumulated a decent amount of trophies over the years. Tottenham has won two league titles, eight FA Cups, 
                four league cups, and seven community shields. Outside of England they have won the UEFA Cup Winners Cupand the UEFA Europa League
                three times. This year Tottenham are currently competing in the UEFA Champions league the most prestigious european competition. 
                They are also 8th in the premier league but only fall short 2 points of the top four. 
                Tottenham unfortunately have been eliminated from both domestic tournaments the FA and EFL cup for this season.

                Tottenham has had many world class players play for them. In their history they have always had standout players who have left 
                and become amazing players. Some of these being Gareth Bale and Luka Modric who were outstanding players who left for Real Madrid
                where they became someof the greatest players ever. Another is Harry Kane (Tottenhams top goalscorer) who left for Bayern Munchen
                and is arguably the best in the world right now. One more legend to play for Tottenham is Heung Min-Son who is the most iconic 
                Tottenham player in recent history for his loyalty and class on and off the field. He left at the end of last season after ending the
                trophy draught. He now plays in Los Angeles for LAFC.

                Tottenham may be clowned for not having trophies and always failing at the last moment but they still hold many records and stats
                that other teams do not hold. Tottenham is the first English team to win a major European trophy (1963). They are also the first team 
                to win the league title and FA Cup double in the 20th century. Lastly Tottenham were the first English team to win two different 
                European trophies. Some more lowkey achievements that Tottenham has is being the premier league with the most Puskas Awards (Goal of the year).
                Tottenham also holds the most deadly duo in premier league history, Harry Kane and Heung Min-Son combined for 47 goals making them the most dangerous 
                duo ever.
