                This hattrick (3 goals) by Lucas Moura is by far the most iconic and emotional 3 goals in Tottenhams recent history. Tottenham is losing 2-0
                to Ajax in the UEFA Champions League semi-final. They have been playing horribly and everyone has lost hope. Lucas Moura never stops fighting.
                Through the whole game he is still working and trying to create goals. He finally gets an opening and takes it slotting a shot into the bottom left. 
                He keeps fighting and fighting and get another opportunity from a loose ball in the box. With seconds ticking and the final whistle almost to be
                blown, he gets a flicked long ball by Dele Alli and shoots the stray pass right into the bottom left past Onana's finger tips. The crowd goes crazy
                and tears erupt as he pulled off a miracle.

               This goal by Son Heung-Min versus Burnley is extremely iconic, the goal requires so much skill and talent. He picks the ball up around his own 18 yard box
               and runs the whole length of the field. He runs past around 7 oposition players and then has the poise to slot the ball past the keeper. This goal is easily 
               a top Goal in Son's catalogue. Just the ability to glide past defenders and avade any tackles is something of extreme skill, he makes it look so easy.
               This goal went on to be the goal of the year in 2020.

               This goal is from the Europa League Final 2025 in Bilbao, Spain. Tottenham played Manchester United and won 1-0in a back and forth game.
               This goal is so important because of the magnitude it holds, ending Tottenham's 17 year old trophy draught. All the players for the Spurs
               have dreamt for the opportunity to lift a trophy for the club, and to finally do it solidifies this memory as historic. This goal will forever be in
               the history books and hearts of everyone who watched. Tottenham has always been criticized and slandered for being a bad club, but to end the season defying 
               all doubts and creating a winnning culture for the future is something special.
