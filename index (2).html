                Tottenham is a club from North London founded in 1882. 
                They were founded by 11 schoolboys and slowly gained 
                more and more popularity as the years went on. They did 
                not become a professional team until 1895. Tottenham played in the 
                stadium White Hart Lane until 2015 when the commencement of 
                Tottenham Hotspurs Stadium began. The stadium was finished in 2019 and 
                is one of the largest, most industrial stadiums in the world. 
                Today Tottenham are a wealthy well businessed club, who're highly 
                regarded as a world class team 
                within the top fifteen teams in the world. They're also 
                one of the founding teams in the Premier League where it started 
                in 1992 and still going on today. The Premier League is 
                the most popular and highest level soccer league in the world and 
                Tottenham shares the platform with many other powerhouse teams such 
                as Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Nottingham Forest, 
                Newcastle United, Aston Villa, etc.

            Tottenham has always been a very successful team during their time as a 
            professional club. They have won countless trophies,
            despite the jokes due to the 17 year trophy draught. 
            Even in the trophy draught they have been close to winning many trophies
            and still had many world class players. Some trophies they came close 
            to winning were the 2016-2017 Premier League Champions,
            the 2019 UEFA Champions, 2021 EFL Final. After all these attempts to win
            a trophy the club got the adjective spursy, which means
            they choke at the last minute or get so close and then fail. 
            The trophy draught ended this year (2025) in the Europa League Final vs Manchester United. 
            Tottenham won 1-0 and the winner was scored by the Welshman Brennan Johnson.

            Derbies in soccer are like rivalries in other sports, but unlike a NY Yankees vs Boston Redsox 
            rivalry it is by location. In the English Premier League we have derbies between teams from the 
            same areas. In London, we have the North London between Tottenham & Arsenal, as well as the West 
            London derby between Chelsea, Brentford, Fulham and QPR. These games are huge in magnitude, 
            the meaning and passion go far beyond a regular game. The North London Derby is a long lasting rivalry, 
            the first one being in 1921. For the players and fans it means everything, it is an opportunity for 
            bragging rights and 3 points.
